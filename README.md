# Surfs_Up_Analysis
# Project Overview
Analysis project for W.Avy to review temperature trends in Oahu, Hawaii in order to allow the Board of Directors to make a decision about investing in a surf and ice cream shop business. 

# Resources
Software: Python 3.8.5, Jupyter notebook 6.1.4

# Results 
The statistical results below are displayed for the temperature in the month of June and December 2017.

The main results show:
* There is not a big difference between the mean temperatures in June and December (June temperature is only 3 degrees less).
* The mean minimum temperatures between the two months have a larger variance with December being 56 degrees and June being 64 degrees.
* There is not a big difference between the maximum mean temperatures with December being 83 degrees and June being 85 degrees (2 degress difference). 

# Summary 
Overall there is not a large difference between the temperatures in the months of June and December which may suggest that the surf and ice cream shop may be a good investment all year round due to the little difference in weather. 
Respectively as the analysis looked at the data in June (Spring) and December (Winter), two alternative analyses could look at the data in the Summer and Autumn months. This could provide a better prediction of trend on whether there will be changes in weather between these seasons.
